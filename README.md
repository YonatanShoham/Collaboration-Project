# Collaboration-Project
This project was done in cooperation with a MSc student of The Hebrew University.
The main question asked in this experiment was how seed planting depth and plant diversity affect seed growth.
Six different species of plants were used for this experiment.
Results show that seeds buried relatively deep were the most successful and that plant diversity improved plant survivability until a certain point,after that certain point competition lowered plant surivavalibity.
The results are shown on this project with excel and PowerBI.
